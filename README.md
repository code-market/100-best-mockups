100 best free &amp; premium mockups
Want to know what a mockup is, why you need it, and how to use it? Or are you already a professional designer and looking for fresh ideas or high-quality mockups for your work? All of this and much more you will find in this article.

## What is a mockup and what is it used with?

Mockup is an eco friendly assistant for designers and freelancers from all over the world. With the assistance of mockups, the designer can demonstrate to the customer what the final product will look like. Usually these are already created files in psd format with layers that allow the designer to overlay design elements on the picture of the subject. When working with mockups, the working time is significantly reduced, it is easier to make edits, and as a nice bonus, nature is preserved, because there is no need to print hundreds of pages with possible design options. Mockup is a pre-developed design model of an object or device used to show the appearance of a product. It's a way to visualize how your design will look when it gets out into the real world. You can make a mockup for your product yourself or use the ones already created, which will make your work easier and more convenient. In order to optimize your work, spend less time and do everything more qualitatively, you can use pre-made mockups for your design.

## Why is a mockup a best friend of a designer?

Creating a good mockup is going to take a lot of time, which you could spend on working out your design or on your personal time. So in the interest of saving time, you could use a pre-made mockup. On the Internet, you can find many mockups that are exactly suitable for a successful demonstration of your design. Maybe you will find the mockup you need in the specially chosen mockups at the bottom of this article. Are you wondering why you should use mockups in your work? So let me get this straight. The mockup has a lot of benefits:

### Cutting working hours

Imagine that you need to do a job immediately. You have a design, but you need to prepare it for customer demonstration. To create a product mockup, you will spend an average of 4 to 6 hours, depending on the difficulty and quantity of the mockups. But you can make your work faster, if you download a pre-made mockup. As you know, time is money. For example, you create a design for a weather tracking app. For a successful demonstration, you need to show how the application will look in real time - front end in other words. You can draw the phone model, create smart layers, and spend a lot of time and effort that you could put into working with your creative ideas. So instead of doing the extra work,  just download a good mockup that will show your app perfectly.

### Very convenient for demonstration

Product demonstration is an extremely important step, and the mockup is great for demonstration. Let's assume that you create a T-shirt design for a competition with a large quantity of participants. Your design is excellent, but this is not enough for the competition, because you also need to show it properly. Then you will find an appropriate, original mockup that will accentuate your design.

### Easy to use

Using a mockup is much easier than creating one. The process of creating a mockup is not a simple labor, which takes a lot of time. But using an already made mockup is much easier and helpful for beginning designers. As a rule, mockups are created by professionals, that's why they are technically made very well. This is a good experience that will come in handy later when you will create your own mockup. In the meantime,  to put your design on the mockup, you just need to follow three simple steps.

1.  You load mockup (PSD) into the program where you are working with the design, and in the layer management area, look for the layer with the Smart Object icon. Most often, this layer is marked with "Put your design here" or "Your design".
2.  Click on the smart layer icon.
3.  You will open a new window in which to place your design, and then click "save".
4.  <span style="font-size: 16px;">All ready.</span>

### Point to bug's of the design

Also you can use the mockup to see the design bug. Design of the product doesn't exist apart from it, the image is inseparable from the object on which it is applied. It can be difficult to evaluate the design in its expanded form. That is why the mockup is a great way to see how the design is overlaid on the object, and if there are any bugs to fix. As you can see, using mockups is much better than creating your own. You will save time, effort and your creative potential, and therefore you will be able to earn more spending more time on other things.

## What design software are mockups used for?

You have already learned enough about the benefits of using pre-made mockups, now let's look at the design programs where you can work with it. There are a number of programs for using mockups:

### Sketch

Sketch is a vector graphics editor for macOS. It is primarily used for user interface and user experience design of websites and mobile apps and doesn't include print design features.

### Adobe Photoshop CC

Adobe Photoshop is a multi-functional image editor developed and distributed by Adobe Systems. It mainly works with raster images, but it has some vector tools. Raster images can be used in a variety of ways. They are a grid of pixels — colored dots (usually square) on a display screen. A raster graphics editor is a specialized program designed to create and process raster images, that is, graphics that are written to the computer's memory as a set of points, and not as a set of formulas for geometric shapes. Perfect for working with photos.

### Adobe Illustrator CC

Adobe Illustrator is a vector graphics editor developed and distributed by Adobe Systems.

### Figma

Figma is a vector graphics editor, which works as an online service for creating interfaces and prototyping with the possibility of cooperation in real-time.

### 3D Max

Autodesk 3dsMax is a professional 3D modeling, animation, and visualization software for game development and design.

### Adobe InDesign

Adobe InDesign is an app for desktop publishing and typesetting. It can be used to create works such as posters, flyers, brochures, magazines, newspapers, presentations, books and etc. It allows you to create documents for output to both industrial-level printing machines and desktop printers, as well as export the created documents to various formats of electronic publications.

### Corel DRAW
